# Socketwrap [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/findhit/proxywrap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/findhit/proxywrap)

Add [PROXY protocol](http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt). v1 or v2 support to nodejs sockets. IPv4 and IPv6 protocols supported

## History

This module is a fork of original [proxywrap](https://github.com/cusspvz/proxywrap) by [Josh Dague](https://github.com/daguej), [Jos√© Moreira
](https://github.com/cusspvz) and [Short-io/proxywrap](https://github.com/Short-io/proxywrap). Those projects all relies on hooking/rewriting nodejs servers. This module implement a simplier async "socket validation" callback policy.

This module validate a newly opened nodejs socket, automatically parses the PROXY headers and resets `socket.remoteAddress` and `socket.remotePort` so that they have the correct values. Then trigger a simple callback

This module wraps node's various `Server` interfaces so that they are compatible with the 

This module is especially useful if you need to get the client IP address when you're behind an AWS ELB in TCP mode.

## Installing

```bash
npm install --save socketwrap
```

## Usage

```js
const net = require('net')
var socketwrap  = require('socketwrap');

var srv = new net.Server( async (socket) {
  await socketwrap(socket, {
    override : true,  //default
    strict   : true,  //default
  });

  console.log("IP = %s:%d", socket.remoteAddress, socket.remotePort);
});

srv.listen( 80 )

```
This also adds to all your sockets the properties:
* `socket.clientAddress` - The IP Address that connected to your PROXY.
* `socket.clientPort` - The Port used by who connected to your PROXY.
* `socket.proxyAddress` - The IP Address exposed on Client <-> Proxy side.
* `socket.proxyPort` - The Port exposed on Client <-> Proxy side. Usefull for detecting SSL on AWS ELB.
* `socket.remoteAddress` [optional] - Same as `socket.clientAddress`, used for compability proposes.
* `socket.remotePort` [optional] - Same as `socket.clientPort`, used for compability proposes.

**Warning:** By default, *all* traffic to your proxied server MUST use the PROXY protocol.  If the first five bytes received aren't `PROXY`, the connection will be dropped.  Obviously, the node server accepting PROXY connections should not be exposed directly to the internet; only the proxy (whether ELB, HAProxy, or something else) should be able to connect to node.

## API


### `async socketwrap(socket [, options])`

Wraps a socket, extend it with PROXY protocol support.

Options:

- `strict` (default `true`): Incoming connections MUST use the PROXY protocol.  If the first five bytes received aren't `PROXY`, the connection will be dropped.  Disabling this option will allow connections that don't use the PROXY protocol (so long as the first bytes sent aren't `PROXY`).  Disabling this option poses a security risk; it should be enabled in production.

- `overrideRemote` (default `true`): **socketwrap** overrides `socket.remoteAddress` and `socket.remotePort` for compability proposes. If you set this as `false`, your `socket.remoteAddress` and `socket.remotePort` will have the Address and Port of your **load-balancer** or whatever you are using behind your app. You can also access client's Address and Port by using `socket.clientAddress` and `socket.clientPort`.
